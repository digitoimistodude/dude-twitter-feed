# Dude Tweets feed
WordPress plugin to get latest tweets for user and/or hashtag.

Basically this plugin fetches tweets from Twitter, saves those to transient and next requests will be served from there. After transient has expired and deleted, new fetch from Twitter will be made and saved to transient. This implements very simple cache.

Handcrafted with love at [Digitoimisto Dude Oy](http://dude.fi), a Finnish boutique digital agency in the center of Jyväskylä.

Plugin uses [twitteroauth library](https://github.com/abraham/twitteroauth) made by [Abraham Williams](https://abrah.am/).
